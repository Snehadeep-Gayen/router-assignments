All code is written by me. Kindly run the tests given to ensure that the probability generation is being done correctly on your machine. Further kindly ensure that the `params.json` file is the in the same folder as the binary. Also please note that CMake sometimes fails for folders with a space in their name. Kindly remove all spaces from the folder name before trying to run the compilation commands as in the README.md file.
